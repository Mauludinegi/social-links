- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS hover


### What I learned

In this challenge, I've learned about semantic HTML and CSS. Semantic Element HTML 5 is really a big deal because it represents a significant advancement. And It not only aids screen reader technology but also contributes to SEO.

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of the web page, rather than merely dictating its appearance. These tags provide context to browsers and developers, making it easier to understand the purpose of different sections and elements on a page.

Semantic HTML helps improve accessibility for assistive technologies, such as screen readers, by providing more meaningful information about the content. Moreover, it contributes positively to search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines can better interpret the content and context of the page.

Examples of semantic HTML tags include `<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>`, and more. By using these tags appropriately, developers can create well-structured and meaningful web pages that are both accessible and SEO-friendly.

Also, the CSS concepts I acquired knowledge of include techniques such as using hover effects to change the background color when the mouse hovers over a card or text, adding an interactive and dynamic touch. Additionally, I explored various CSS properties like display and media screen properties, enhancing my ability to control the layout and appearance of elements on different screen sizes.


These are code snippets semantic html and css that i learned, see below:

```html
<body>
  <main>
    <div></div>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p></p>
  </footer>
</body>
```
```css
*,
*:before,
*:after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

:root {

}

.card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(62, 61, 61, 0.2);
}
```


### Continued development

In my next challenge, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to advancing my skills and mastering the art of crafting forms through CSS. I am determined to delve into the intricacies of this essential web development language, pushing my boundaries to achieve a profound understanding and proficiency.

My objective is clear: to transform my ability to create aesthetically pleasing and functional forms that seamlessly integrate into web applications. CSS, with its vast capabilities, serves as the key to unlocking responsive and visually captivating user interfaces.

Wish me luck!
